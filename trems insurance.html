            Investment
            There are two concepts in the financial industry, on which many transactions take place. They are Savings and Investments. When talked about execution, there is a big difference between both the concepts, though.

            What is Investment?
            In the financial context, investment is any money or fund that you spend today to reap financial benefits in future. Any investment made by you is an act to create or buy assets expecting a return in form of capital appreciation, interest earning or dividend. This return is profitable in comparison to the funds invested in the initial stages. You can differentiate almost all the investments from various other types of transactions depending on the intention of spending money. The money you spent on making an investment is basically with the intent to obtain some kind of return in a certain period of time.
